Pilot_model.py contains the domain information to simulate a pilot-scale MET system with two or three bacterial species and two substrates. 
The preamble contains all variables which can be altered to adjust geometry size, retention times and simulation length. 
All electrochemical variables are specified and consistent with the model defined in 

Python scripts in this repo:

1) Object_classes.py - Python functions and classes for simulation of MET
2) Pilot_model.py - Main python script for simulation of a single population single substrate MET system
3) Plotting_jd.py - Custom plotting functions
4) Solver.py - Fluid solving algorithm returning the steady state solution
